            <h2>About My Self.</h2>
            <p>Hi I am Mosharul Islam Juha. I am from Sylhet in Bangladesh. I study at Leading University. I really love this course. Web design is important in recent life. I also love playing Indoor games with my brother. And, I love playing cricketwith my friends. I am a very honest and decent boy and follow all the instructions from my parents and teachers.I would like to listen to music, explore new technologies, and to do origami (paper crafts). Talking about my strengths. I'm a hard worker, very determined and well-disciplined and punctual. Talking about my weaknesses. I'm a perfectionist and I'm a workaholic.
            And that's all about me </p>
