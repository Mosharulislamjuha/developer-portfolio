            <h2>About My Self.</h2>
            <p>Hi I am Mosharul Islam Juha. I am from Sylhet in Bangladesh. I study at Leading University. I really love this course. Web design is important in recent life. I also love playing Indoor games with my brother. And, I love playing cricketwith my friends. I am a very honest and decent boy and follow all the instructions from my parents and teachers.I would like to listen to music, explore new technologies, and to do origami (paper crafts). Talking about my strengths. I'm a hard worker, very determined and well-disciplined and punctual. Talking about my weaknesses. I'm a perfectionist and I'm a workaholic.
            And that's all about me </p>

                    The climb up takes two to three hours, moving through fig trees, oleander and broom at the base to sparse shrubs further up and finally nothing but black volcanic rock. If you set off in the afternoon, you reach the summit at dusk. Hard-hat on, you spend an hour ooh-ing and ahh-ing as magma bubbles through the volcano’s vents.

                    These coral-fringed islands offer lush forest scenery, unspoiled white beaches and plentiful opportunities for scuba diving in their pristine turquoise waters. Get hands-on with turtle conservation projects or stretch your legs on a trek through inland jungle brimming with wildlife (including exotic birds, monkeys and giant monitor lizards).
